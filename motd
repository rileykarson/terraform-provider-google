Not your first time? All you need to do to get started:
1. Type 'export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="{{PROJECT-NAME}}"' with your project name
2. Run 'terraform init'
3. Run 'terraform apply'!

These examples use real resources that will be billed to the
Google Cloud Platform project you use - so make sure that you
run "terraform destroy" before quitting!
