Welcome to Terraform in Cloud Shell!

Bored of the tutorial? All you need to do to get started:
1. Fill in your project in main.tf
2. Run "terraform init"
3. Run "terraform apply"!

This uses real resources that will be billed to your
GCP project - so make sure you run "terraform destroy"
before quitting!
