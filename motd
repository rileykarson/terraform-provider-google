Not your first time? All you need to do to get started:
1. Fill in your project in main.tf
2. Run "terraform init"
3. Run "terraform apply"!

These examples use real resources that will be billed to the
Google Cloud Platform project you use - so make sure that you
run "terraform destroy" before quitting!
